# Learned while inputting big number

After learning how to input and output in C, I tried to input a big number in the next code.

~~~C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  {
      int input;
      printf("input a number\n");
      scanf("%d", &input);
      printf("input number : %d\n",input);
    }
  return 0;
}
~~~

Putting ```123456789000``` in, the code returned ```input number : -1097262584```.

...Wait what?

There was nothing different from the normal code, so I had to find the reason from other part. Soon I could know that 'Data Types' was the matter.

# Data Types

There are various data types as int, float, double, etc. Each data type has different range upto which it can store number, and different format specifier required. So the reason the code returned strange number was because a data type 'int' can't hande that big number. Checking the following table, I could realize what data type I should have used.

|Data Type|Range|Format Specifier|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| char | -128 to 127 | %c |
| short | -32,768 to 32,767 | %hd |
| int | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 | %d |
| long | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 | %ld |
| long long | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | %lld |
