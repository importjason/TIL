# How to start the code

~~~C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("hello world \n");
}
~~~

To start the code in C, it is essestial to include **<stdio..h>**.

**```#```** is preprocessing code, which tells the computer what to do before compiling. It does not affect other process nor variations.

**```#include```** is same as copying and pasting the text of heather file behind. I thought it is similar to ```import``` in python, but ```import``` is different from ```#include``` given that

**```stdio.h```** is a heather file which various declarations are written in. There's no 구현, because 구현 in heather file brings error(it will twist the comde process).

So **``````**

# Difference between ```int main()```,```void main()```,```main(void)```,```main()```

To get to the point, there's no difference.

```void main()```,```main(void)```,```main()``` are same.
