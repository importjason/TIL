# How to start the printing code

To start the printing code in C, it is essential to include **<stdio.h>**.

**```#```** is preprocessing code, which tells the computer what to do before compiling. It does not affect other processes or variations.

**```#include```** is the same as copying and pasting texts of following heather file. I thought it is similar to ```import``` in python, but what it does make the package name unnecessary in case of using the class in the package. Given that, ```#include``` is different from ```import```.

**```<stdio.h>```** is a name of a heather file in which various declarations are written. 'stdio' means standard input and output, and '.h' means heather, the extension.

So the role **```#include <stdio.h>```** plays is to bring the information in the heather file <stdio.h> before starting compiling.

# Difference between ```int main()```,```void main()```,```main(void)```,```main()```

To get to the point, there's no difference for users, but for the computer.

```void main()```,```main(void)```,```main()``` are same.

```main()``` is a function that initiates compiling and returns a value at the end, so ```int main()``` means there will be a integer returned at the end. ```void main()```,```main(void)```,```main()``` will return nothing.

Returning zero seems unnecessary, but the computer can determine whether the process has ended successfully by checking it. But actually, ```return 0``` for ```int main()``` can be omitted from C99 because the compiler adds it automatically.
