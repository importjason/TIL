# The goal of studying data extraction

My school adopted 'Milage Betting' system for class registration, which makes students bet their limited milage on classes they want. The students who bet lower milage than the others fail to register the class.

Preparing for the class registration, I thought maybe I could find a linear rules between the milage needed for successful registration, and the ratio of successful to total applicants.

So the next program I am preparing for is "Milage Calculator", which utilizes the betting result data on the school website, and I felt learning the web extraction and linear regression essential to develop it.

# Web Crawling and Web Scraping

Web crawling is about discovering URLs or links on the web, while web scraping is about extracting tha data from websites. Usually, web crawling and web scraping is combined in web extracting project. So the sequence will be : Crawling URLs - Downloading the HTML files - Scraping the data from the files.

In the TILs about web data extraction, the content abbout web scraping will be more important, and may include TILs about HTML and CSS.
