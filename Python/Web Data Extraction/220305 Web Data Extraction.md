# The goal of studying data extraction

My school adopted a 'Milage Betting' system for class registration, which makes students bet their limited mileage on classes they want. The students who bet lower milage than the others fail to register for the class.

Preparing for the class registration, I thought maybe I could find a linear rule between the milage needed for successful registration, and the ratio of successful to total applicants.

So, the program I am preparing is a 'mileage calculator' using the betting result data on the school website, and I felt that it is essential to learn web extraction and linear regression.

# Web Crawling and Web Scraping

Web crawling is about discovering URLs or links on the web, while web scraping is about extracting the data from websites. Usually, web crawling and web scraping are combined in a web extracting project. So the sequence will be : Crawling URLs - Downloading the HTML files - Scraping the data from the files.

In the TILs about web data extraction, the content about web scraping will be treated more and may include TILs about HTML and CSS.
